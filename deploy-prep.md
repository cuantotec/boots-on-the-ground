# Static Deployment Preparation Checklist

## Current Configuration Status ✅
- ✅ Build command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Output directory: `dist`
- ✅ Static deployment configured in `.replit`
- ✅ SPA routing rewrites configured
- ✅ Cache headers optimized

## Pre-deployment Steps
1. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
2. Run `npm run build` to test the build process
3. Verify `dist` folder is created with all static files
4. Test the application locally with `npm run preview`

## Files Important for Static Deployment
- `package.json` - Contains build scripts
- `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
- `client/index.html` - Entry point
- `client/src/**` - Source files
- `.replit` - Deployment configuration

## Deployment on Replit
Your project is already configured for Replit's static deployment:
1. Click "Deploy" in the top right
2. Select "Static" deployment type
3. Use existing configuration (build: `npm run build`, public: `dist`)
4. Deploy!

The static deployment will automatically handle SPA routing and cache optimization.
